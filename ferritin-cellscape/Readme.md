# Rust port of Cellscape

- cellscape takes  a structure and projects the results down to a pretty 2D image
- this crate aims to port it to Rust.
- initials work: load a stuct, calc the svg and write it to disk


```sh

cargo run --example simple     # basic shapes
cargo run --example simple_02  # basic protein by residue
```
