This post is a quick announcement [fixed spelling] of updates to 3 projects and the creation of an umbrella organization
to house them: [ferritin-bio](https://github.com/ferritin-bio)


# Ferritin

Rust library for handling proteins.

- Tagged a v.0.1
- Candle-native AMPLIFY model
- ONNX versions of LigandMPNN encoder, LigandMPNN decoder, and ESM2.
- Conversion of PDB files to matrices that can be used for any of the three models [fixed spelling] above.

# Protein-Language-Models

Collation of model info.

- [Github Repo](https://github.com/ferritin-bio/protein-language-models)
- [Dashboard](https://ferritin-bio.github.io/protein-language-models/)
- [gSheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iJ7bPG81_yYITVQn-huoQonKTel7GBQ7AMM9AixQbH8/edit?gid=1996577388#gid=1996577388)


# Fennec

Local Application for running protein language models on one's [added apostrophe] own hardware. **Kick the [tires here](https://github.com/ferritin-bio/fennec/releases/tag/app-v0.1.0-dev)!**

## Residue Specific LigandMPNN Predictions

- LigandMPNN weights converted to ONNX and stored on HFHub
- Click Protein:
    - encode the whole protein
    - decode the predictions per-residue.
- can optionally adjust [fixed spelling] decode temperature
- **only works for single chain proteins at the moment**

## All Sequence Prediction

Return predicted probabilities [fixed spelling] of sequences using masked sequence models ESM2 and AMPLIFY.

## Contact Map Prediction [fixed spelling]

- Use AMPLIFY and return the attention heads.
- calculate the pseudo-contact map/
